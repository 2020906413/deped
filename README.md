# PUNB ASSET TAGGING AUTOMATE WEB APP USING CODE READER
# ABSTRACT
This final year project is aimed at developing a comprehensive asset tagging system for PUNB (Perbanan Usahawan Nasional Berhad), a government organization established by the government of Malaysia to assist and develop national entrepreneurs. The main function of PUNB is as a government agency to provide assistance and guidance to national entrepreneurs in building and developing their businesses. The asset tagging system is specifically designed to manage the inventory of IT assets, which play a crucial role in the operations of PUNB. The system uses barcode technology to ensure accurate and efficient recording of IT asset data, which is essential for effective asset management. One of the main objectives of this project is to simplify the process of recording data related to IT assets, thus reducing the time and effort required for manual data entry and allowing for real-time updates. The use of barcode technology will eliminate the risk of human error and provide a more reliable method for tracking IT assets. The asset tagging system will also provide improved visibility into PUNB's IT assets, allowing for better decision-making and improved asset utilization. This project will also evaluate the feasibility of using asset tagging for PUNB's IT assets and determine the best practices for implementing the system in a manner that is effective and efficient. The results of this project will contribute to the development of a more efficient and effective asset management system for PUNB and provide valuable insights into the potential benefits of using asset tagging for other organizations. In conclusion, the asset tagging system will provide PUNB with a powerful tool for managing its IT assets, improving data accuracy and reducing manual efforts. This project will pave the way for the development of a more effective and efficient asset management system that will help PUNB to optimize its operations and maximize the value of its IT assets.

# Research Background
Perbadanan Usahawan Nasional Berhad (PUNB) currently operates a paper- based system for the acceptance and tracking of assets. This system requires users to fill in a form whenever an asset is handed over to them. However, this method of tracking assets is prone to errors and inefficiencies, particularly when the original form is missing. This issue has become a growing concern for PUNB, as the loss of assets due to improper tracking and record-keeping has become a serious issue.
The problem of asset mismanagement and loss is further compounded by staff misconduct, including asset misappropriation. According to Tajudin et al. (2022), the root cause of these issues is the inadequate method of recording and tracking assets. In order to address these challenges, PUNB is exploring the implementation of a new system that utilizes QR code technology.
The QR code system will provide a more secure and efficient method of tracking assets, as well as reducing the potential for errors and mismanagement. This will ultimately help PUNB to improve its asset management practices, reducing the risk of asset loss and misappropriation, and improving overall accountability and transparency in the handling of company assets.
